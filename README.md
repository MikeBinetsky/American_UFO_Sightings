# American UFO Sightings

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate skills using Tableau and Javascript mapping. 

## Tableau
Utilizing UFO sightings data from Kaggle.com, we created various visualizations to show relationships in the data including a map and adjustable timeline as well as a word cloud of the most used descriptive words for the sighted UFOs.

## Javascript
Using the same UFO sightings data, we converted the data into a usable format to import into a javascript mapping algorithm. From there we used the map to create pins on the map representing each of the sightings.
